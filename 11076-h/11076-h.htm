<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>Those who think that people in high positions live a life of
ease and comfort received a rude shock last week. It is said that,
while visiting the Royal Enfield Works canteen, the Duke of
CONNAUGHT drank two glasses of Government ale.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Britons have no monopoly of pluck, it seems. Last week a Basuto
soldier attached to a labour battalion offered the LORD MAYOR'S
coachman a cigarette.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Two German bankers, formerly of London, have been arrested in
New York as dangerous aliens. Neither of them is a member of our
Privy Council.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is understood that the Spanish Government has addressed a
note to the Allies explaining that all possible precautions will
have been taken against the forthcoming escape of U23.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The PREMIER has received the magnificent gold casket containing
the freedom of the City of London conferred on him last April. A
momentary excitement was caused by the rumour that the Corporation
had thrown off all restraint and filled it with tea.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Brigadier-General has been fined for shooting game on Sunday
in Hampshire. Sir DOUGLAS HAIG, we understand, has generously
arranged to close down the War on the first Wednesday in every
month, in order that the Higher Command may assist in supplying the
hospitals with game.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Seven lunatics have escaped from a South Wales Asylum. It is
assumed that they got away by disguising themselves as German
prisoners.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It has been decided that Counsel may appear before the High
Court dressed as Special Constables. It seems almost certain that
this news was withheld from Sir JOHN SIMON until he had definitely
consented to join Sir DOUGLAS HAIG'S Staff.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Two million pounds of jam per week, "the greater part
strawberry," are being, it is stated, delivered to the Army. Only
the fact that the Army Service Corps' labels all happen to be "plum
and apple" prevents the stuff being distributed to our brave
troops.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Attempts to destroy livestock destined for the Allies are being
investigated, says a New York paper. Only a few days ago, it will
be remembered, a certain Legation discovered that its seals had
been tampered with.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is announced that the War Office has taken over "the greater
part" of the new London County Hall. Our casualties were
insignificant.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We are sorry to say that Mr. CHARLES HAWTREY'S latest success,
<i>The Saving Grace</i>, is not dedicated to Sir ARTHUR YAPP.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is no foundation for the report that the recent
postponement of the production of <i>Cash on Delivery</i> at the
Palace was due to the fact that a new joke was alleged to have been
let loose in Mr. Justice DARLING'S court.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Extravagant funerals have been condemned by Sir JOHN PAGET at
the Law Society Appeal Tribunal, and undertakers are complaining
that in consequence many of their best customers have decided to
postpone their interment till better times.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Cats should be brought inside the house during air-raids," says
the Feline Defence League. When left on the roof they are liable to
be mistaken for aerial torpedoes.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>According to the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> German soldiers on the
Western Front have formed "Wilhelm Clubs," the members of which are
compelled on oath to undertake the work of gaining information
about the British lines. We understand that the terms for
life-membership are most moderate.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A German prisoner named BOLDT has escaped from Leigh internment
camp. It is stated that he would have experienced no additional
difficulty in escaping if he had been called by any other name.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"We want no patched-up peace," says Mr. RAMSAY MACDONALD. But if
the assaults upon pacifist meetings continue we feel sure there
will be some patched-up peacemongers.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Twopenny dinners are the speciality at a Northern munition
works' canteen. We have long been used to twopenny meals, but of
course much more was charged for them.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There appears to be no truth in the report that a burglar has
been fined for infringing the Defence of the Realm Regulations by
using an unshaded lantern.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An application is to be made to the LORD CHANCELLOR for a County
Court for the Hendon district, though a contemporary remarks that
it is doubtful whether there is sufficient work to be done there.
But surely this is just the sort of case that could be met by a
little judicious advertising.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Parliament is to be asked to pass a vote of thanks to the Naval
and Military Forces of the Crown. And it is thought that the latter
will reciprocate by thanking Parliament for giving them such a
jolly little war.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Much concern has been caused by the announcement that bees are
entirely without winter stocks. We have pleasure in recording a
gallant but unavailing attempt to remedy the situation on the part
of two dear old ladies, who thought the paper said "socks."</p>

LITTLE BROTHER?"</p>
<p><i>The Sister.</i> "PLEASE, MISS, 'E'S WORRYIN' ABOUT

</div>
<hr />
<h3>Punch's Roll of Honour.</h3>
<p>We regret to hear that Captain E.G.V. KNOX, Lincolnshire
Regiment, has been wounded. The many friends of "Evoe" will wish
him a speedy and complete recovery.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<blockquote>"Batches of one of its regiments were in<br />
such a hurry to get out of the Ypres front<br />
when relieved by the 92nd Regiment that<br />
they left without giving the newcomers infor-<br />

<p>The line seems to have been seriously disorganised in
consequence.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>The Babe went to England on leave. Not that this was any new
experience for him; he usually pulled it off about once a
quarter&mdash;influence, and that sort of thing, you know. He went
down to the coast in a carriage containing seventeen other men, but
he got a fat sleepy youth to sit on, and was passably comfortable.
He crossed over in a wobbly boat packed from cellar to attic with
Red Tabs invalided with shell shock, Blue Tabs with trench fever,
and Green Tabs with brain-fag; Mechanical Transporters in spurs and
stocks, jam merchants in revolvers and bowie-knives, Military
Police festooned with <i>pickelhaubes</i>, and here and there a
furtive fighting man who had got away by mistake, and would be
recalled as soon as he landed.</p>
<p>The leave train rolled into Victoria late in the afternoon. Cab
touts buzzed about the Babe, but he would have none of them; he
would go afoot the better to see the sights of the village&mdash;a
leisurely sentimental pilgrimage. He had not covered one hundred
yards when a ducky little thing pranced up to him, squeaking,
"Where are your gloves, Sir?" "I always put 'em in cold storage
during summer along with my muff and boa, dear," the Babe replied
pleasantly. "Moreover, my mother doesn't like me to talk to
strangers in the streets, so ta-ta." The little creature blushed
like a tea-rose and stamped its little hoof. "Insolence!" it
squeaked. "You&mdash;you go back to France by the next boat!" and
the Babe perceived to his horror that he had been witty to an
Assistant Provost-Marshal! He flung himself down on his knees,
licking the A.P.M.'s boots and crying in a loud voice that he would
be good and never do it again.</p>
<p>The A.P.M. pardoned the Babe (he wanted to save the polish on
his boots) on condition that he immediately purchased a pair of
gloves of the official cut and hue. The Babe did so forthwith and
continued on his way. He had not continued ten yards when another
A.P.M. tripped him up. "That cap is a disgrace, Sir!" he barked. "I
know it, Sir," the Babe admitted, "and I'm awfully sorry about it;
but that hole in it only arrived last night&mdash;shrapnel, you
know&mdash;and I haven't had time to buy another yet. I don't care
for the style they sell in those little French shops&mdash;do
you?"</p>
<p>The A.P.M. didn't know anything about France or its little
shops, and didn't intend to investigate; at any rate not while
there was a war on there. "You will return to the Front to-morrow,"
said he. The Babe grasped his hand from him and shook it warmly.
"Thank you&mdash;thank you, Sir," he gushed; "I didn't want to
come, but they made me. I'm from Fiji; have no friends here, and
London is somehow so different from Suva it makes my head ache. I
am broke and couldn't afford leave, anyway. Thank you,
Sir&mdash;thank you."</p>
<p>"Ahem&mdash;in that case I will revoke my decision," said the
A.P.M. "Buy yourself an officially-sanctioned cap and carry
on."</p>
<p>The Babe bought one with alacrity; then, having tasted enough of
the dangers of the streets for one afternoon, took a taxi, and,
lying in the bottom well out of sight, sped to his old hotel. When
he reached his old hotel he found it had changed during his
absence, and was now headquarters of the Director of Bones and
Dripping. He abused the taxi-driver, who said he was sorry, but
there was no telling these days; a hotel was a hotel one moment,
and the next it was something entirely different. Motion pictures
weren't in it, he said.</p>
<p>Finally they discovered a hotel which was still behaving as
such, and the Babe got a room. He remained in that room all the
evening, beneath the bed, having his meals pushed in to him under
the door. A prowling A.P.M. sniffed at the keyhole but did not
investigate further, which was fortunate for the Babe, who had no
regulation pyjamas.</p>
<p>Next morning, crouched on the bottom boards of another taxi, he
was taken to his tailor, poured himself into the faithful fellow's
hands, and only departed when guaranteed to be absolutely
A.P.M.-proof. He went to the "Bolero" for lunch, ordered some
oysters for a start, polished them off and bade the waiter trot up
the <i>consomm&eacute;</i>. The waiter shook his head, "Can't be
done, Sir. Subaltern gents are only allowed three and sixpenceworth
of food and you've already had that, Sir. If we was to serve you
with a crumb more, we'd be persecuted under the Trading with the
Enemy Act, Sir. There's an A.P.M. sitting in the corner this very
moment, Sir, his eyeglass fixed on your every mouthful very
suspicious-like&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" said the Babe, and bolted. He bolted as far as the
next restaurant, had a three-and-sixpenny <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
there, went on to another for sweets, and yet another for coffee
and trimmings. These short bursts between courses kept his appetite
wonderfully alive.</p>
<p>That afternoon he ran across a lady friend in Bond Street, "a
War Toiler enormously interested in the War" (see the current
number of <i>Social Snaps</i>). She had been at Yvonne's trying on
her gauze for the Boccaccio Tableaux in aid of the Armenians and
needed some relaxation. So she engaged the Babe for the play, to be
followed by supper with herself and her civilian husband. The play
(a War-drama) gave the Babe a fine hunger, but the Commissionaire
(apparently a Major-General) who does odd jobs outside the Blitz
took exception to him. "Can't go in, Sir." "Why not?" the Babe
inquired; "my friends have gone in." "Yessir, but no hofficers are
allowed to obtain nourishment after 10 p.m. under Defence of the
Realm Act, footnote (<i>a</i>) to para. 14004." He leaned forward
and whispered behind his glove, "There's a Hay Pee Hem under the
portico watching your movements, Sir." The Babe needed no further
warning; he dived into his friends' Limousine and burrowed under
the rug.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg
283]</span>
<p>Sometime later the door of the car was opened cautiously and the
moon-face of the Major-General inserted itself through the crack.
"Hall clear for the moment, Sir; the Hay Pee Hem 'as gorn orf dahn
the street, chasin' a young hofficer in low shoes. 'Ere, tyke this;
I'm a hold soldier meself." He thrust a damp banana in the Babe's
hand and closed the door softly.</p>
<p>Next morning the Babe dug up an old suit of 1914 "civies" and
put them on. A woman in the Tube called him "Cuthbert" and informed
him gratuitously that her husband, twice the Babe's age, had
volunteered the moment Conscription was declared and had been
fighting bravely in the Army Clothing Department ever since.
Further she supposed the Babe's father was in Parliament and that
he was a Conscientious Objector. In Hyde Park one urchin addressed
him as "Daddy" and asked him what he was doing in the Great War;
another gambolled round and round him making noises like a rabbit.
In Knightsbridge a Military Policeman wanted to arrest him as a
deserter. The Babe hailed a taxi and, cowering on the floor, fled
back to his hotel and changed into uniform again.</p>
<p>That night, strolling homewards in the dark immersed in thought,
he inadvertently took a pipe out of his pocket and lit it. An
A.P.M. who had been sleuthing him for half-a-mile leapt upon him,
snatched the pipe and two or three teeth out of his mouth and
returned him to France by the next boat.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>His groom, beaming welcome, met him at the railhead with the
horses.</p>
<p>"Hello, old thing, cheerio and all the rest of it," Huntsman
whinnied lovingly.</p>
<p>Miss Muffet rubbed her velvet muzzle against his pocket.
"Brought a lump of sugar for a little girl?" she rumbled.</p>
<p>He mounted her and headed across country, Miss Muffet
pig-jumping and capering to show what excellent spirits she
enjoyed.</p>
<p>Two brigades of infantry were under canvas in Mud Gully, their
cook fires winking like red eyes. The guards clicked to attention
and slapped their butts as the Babe went by. A subaltern bobbed out
of a tent and shouted to him to stop to tea. "We've got cake," he
lured, but the Babe went on.</p>
<p>A red-hat cantered across the stubble before him waving a
friendly crop, "Pip" Vibart the A.P.M. homing to H.Q. "Evening,
boy!" he holloaed; "come up and Bridge to-morrow night," and swept
on over the hillside. A flight of aeroplanes, like flies in the
amber of sunset, droned overhead <i>en route</i> for Hunland. The
Babe waved his official cap at them: "Good hunting, old dears."</p>
<p>They had just started feeding up in the regimental lines when he
arrived; the excited neighing of five hundred horses was music to
his ears. His brother subalterns hailed his return with loud and
exuberant noises, made disparaging remarks about the smartness of
his clothes, sat on him all over the floor and rumpled him. On
sighting the Babe, The O'Murphy went mad and careered round the
table wriggling like an Oriental dancer, uttering shrill yelps of
delight; presently he bounced out of the window, to enter some
minutes later by the same route, and lay the offering of a freshly
slain rat at his best beloved's feet.</p>
<p>At this moment the skipper came in plastered thick with the mud
of the line, nodded cheerfully to his junior sub and
instantaneously fell upon the buttered toast.</p>
<p>"Have a good time, Son?" he mumbled. "How's merrie England?"</p>
<p>"Oh, England's all right, Sir," said the Babe, tickling The
O'Murphy's upturned tummy&mdash;"quite all right; but it's jolly to
be home again among one's ain folk."</p>

<h2>PRESENCE OF MIND.</h2>
<p>The train came to one of those sudden stops in which the hush
caused by the contrast between the rattle of the wheels and their
silence is almost painful. During these pauses one is conscious of
conversation in neighbouring compartments, without however hearing
any distinct words.</p>
<p>There were several of us, strangers to each other, who hitherto
had been minding our own business, but under the stress of this
untoward thing became companionable.</p>
<p>A man at each window craned his body out, but withdrew it
without information.</p>
<p>"I hope," said another, "there's not an accident."</p>
<p>"I have always heard," said a fourth, "that in a railway
accident presence of mind is not so valuable as absence of
body"&mdash;getting off this ancient pleasantry as though it were
his own.</p>
<p>The motionlessness of the train was so absolute as to be
disconcerting; also a scandal. The business of trains, between
stations, is to get on. We had paid our money, not for undue
stoppages, but for movement in the direction of our various goals;
and it was infamous.</p>
<p>Somebody said something of the kind.</p>
<p>"Better be held up now," said a sententious man, "than be killed
for want of prudence."</p>
<p>No one was prepared to deny this, but we resented its truth and
availed ourselves of a true-born free Briton's right to doubt the
wisdom of those in authority. We all, in short, looked as though we
knew better than engine-driver, signalman or guard. That is our
<i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>
<p>Some moments, which, as in all delays on the line, seemed like
hours, passed and nothing happened. Looking out I saw heads and
shoulders protruding from every window, with curiosity stamped on
all their curves.</p>
<p>"They should tell us what's the matter," said an impatient man.
"That's one of the stupid things in England&mdash;no one ever tells
you what's wrong. No tact in this country&mdash;no
imagination."</p>
<p>We all agreed. No imagination. It was the national curse.</p>
<p>"And yet," said another man with a smile, "we get there."</p>
<p>"Ah! that's our luck," said the impatient man. "We have luck far
beyond our deserts." He was very cross about it.</p>
<p>Again the first man to speak hoped it was not an accident; and
again the second man, fearing that someone might have missed it,
repeated the old jest about presence of mind and absence of
body.</p>
<p>"Talking of presence of mind," said a man who had not yet
spoken, emerging from his book, "an odd thing happened to me not so
very long ago&mdash;since the War&mdash;and, as it chances,
happened in a railway carriage too&mdash;as it might be in this. It
is a story against a friend of mine, and I hope he's wiser now, but
I'll tell it to you."</p>
<p>We had not asked for his story but we made ourselves up to
listen.</p>
<p>"It was during the early days of the War," he said, "before some
of us had learned better, and my friend and I were travelling to
the North. He is a very good fellow, but a little hasty, and a
little too much disposed to think everyone wrong but himself.
Opposite us was a man hidden behind a newspaper, all that was
visible of him being a huge pair of legs in knickerbockers, between
which was a bag of golf-clubs.</p>
<p>"My friend at that time was not only suspicious of everyone's
patriotism but a deadly foe of golf. He even went so far as to call
it Scotch croquet and other contemptuous names. I saw him watching
the clubs and the paper and speculating on the age of the man,
whose legs were, I admit, noticeably young, and he drew my
attention to him too&mdash;by nudges and whispers. Obviously this
was a shirker.</p>
<p>"For a while my friend contented himself with half-suppressed
snorts and other signs of disapproval, but at last he could hold
himself in no longer. Leaning forward he tapped the man smartly on
the knee, with the question, 'Why aren't you in khaki?' It was an
inquiry, you will remember, that was being much put at the
time&mdash;before compulsion came in.</p>
<p>"We all&mdash;there were two or three other people in the
compartment&mdash;felt that this was going too far; and I knew it
only too well when the man lowered his paper to see what was
happening and revealed an elderly face with a grey beard absolutely
out of keeping with those vigorous legs.</p>
<p>"To my intense relief, however, he seemed to have been too much
engrossed by his paper to have heard. At any rate he asked my
friend to repeat his remark.</p>
<p>"Here, you will agree, was, if ever, an opening for what we call
presence of mind.</p>
<p>"My friend, like myself, had been so taken aback by the
apparition of more than middle age which confronted him when the
paper was lowered that for the moment he could say nothing; the
other passengers were in an ecstasy of anticipation; the man
himself, a formidable antagonist if he became nasty, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span> waited
for the reply with a non-committal expression which might conceal
pugnacity and might genuinely have resulted from not hearing and
desiring to hear.</p>
<p>"And then occurred one of the most admirable instances of
resourcefulness in history. With an effort of self-collection and a
readiness for which I shall always honour him, my friend said,
speaking with precise clearness, 'I beg your pardon, Sir, but,
mistaking you for a golfing friend of mine at Babbacombe, I asked
you why you were not in Torquay. I offer my apologies.'</p>
<p>"At these words the golfer bowed and resumed his paper, the
other passengers ceased for the moment to have the faintest
interest in a life which was nothing but Dead Sea fruit, and my
friend uttered a sigh of relief as he registered a vow never to be
a meddlesome idiot again. But he looked years older."</p>

<h2>THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.</h2>
<h3>II.</h3>
<h3>Conversation on Chapter IV.</h3>
<p><i>George.</i> I must ask you, Mamma, before we talk of anything
else, whether Withsak and Alldane were beheaded?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> No; you will be relieved to hear that, although
ALFRED was greatly incensed against them and had resolved to
proceed to the enforcement of the extreme penalty, they were
rescued by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury and
afterwards granted a free pardon on condition of abstaining from
all participation in public life. This magnanimity on the part of
ALFRED is all the more praiseworthy as many people firmly believed
that these two princes had attempted to poison him, and that they
were responsible for all the calamities which had befallen England
from the invasion of JULIUS C&AElig;SAR, and which were destined to
befall her till the end of time. Indeed a writer in an old saga,
known as the Blackblood Saga, went so far as to maintain that the
English climate had been permanently ruined by the incantations of
Prince Alldane. Undoubtedly his name was an unfortunate one at the
time, but, to judge by the old portraits I showed you, neither of
these princes looked capable of such atrocities, and Prince Alldane
was described as being the essence of rotundity.</p>
<p><i>Richard.</i> Did not ALFRED invent the quartern loaf?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Yes; before his time the nobles lived exclusively
on cake and venison, while the peasantry subsisted on herbs and a
substance named woad, which was most injurious to their digestions.
ALFRED, who among his many accomplishments was an expert baker,
himself gave instructions to the wives of the poor, supplied them
with flour, the grinding of which was carried out in mills of his
own devising, and insisted that all loaves should be made of a
certain quality and size, with results most beneficial to the
physique of his subjects. The story of his quarrel with the woman
who would insist on baking cakes illustrates the difficulties he
encountered in effecting his reforms.</p>
<p><i>Mary.</i> Was not ALFRED called "England's Darling"?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Yes, my dear, and no wonder. Before his time
there were no proper newspapers, the few issued being of high price
and written in an elaborate style which only appealed to the highly
educated. ALFRED changed all this, and insisted that they should be
written in a "simple, sensuous and passionate style." This was one
of the causes of his falling out with Withsak, who supported the
old-fashioned methods, while ALFRED was in favour of simplicity and
brevity. You will find all this related in the work of Leo Maximus,
a learned writer, the friend and admirer of ALFRED and author of
his Life.</p>
<p><i>George.</i> How much I should like to read it.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> You would find in it some inspiring and
interesting particulars of ALFRED's conversations and private
life.</p>
<p><i>Mary.</i> How many things ALFRED did! I cannot think how he
found time for them all.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> He found time by never <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span>
wasting it. One-third of his time he devoted to religious exercises
and to study, another third to sleep and necessary refreshment, and
the other to the affairs of his kingdom. The benefits he bestowed
on his country were so great and various that even to this day we
hardly comprehend them fully, and some ungrateful people refuse to
regard them as benefits at all.</p>
<p><i>Richard.</i> How sad! But thanks to you, dear Mamma, we know
better. When Papa comes in to tea I will ask him when he thinks I
shall be old enough to read all the books that have ever been
written about KING ALFRED. I want to know everything about him.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p><i>Tuesday, October 16th</i>.&mdash;To Mr. Punch's blunt
inquiry, "Why?" in last week's cartoon different answers would, I
suppose, be returned by various Members. The CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUER would say that the reassembling of Parliament was
necessary in order that he might obtain a further Vote of Credit
from the representatives of the taxpayers. Brigadier-General PAGE
CROFT, inventor and C.-in-C. of the new "National" party, who has
already attached to himself a following not inferior numerically to
the little band which, under Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL in the
eighties, struck terror into the hearts of the Front Benches, longs
to prove that, under his brilliant leadership, Lord DUNCANNON, Sir
RICHARD COOPER and Major ROWLAND HUNT will emulate the early
prowess of Sir JOHN GORST, Sir HENRY DRUMMOND-WOLFF and Mr. ARTHUR
BALFOUR.</p>
<p>But a word to the gallant General: he will do little until he
has secured a corner-seat. By hook or by crook Mr. HOUSTON, "the
Pirate King," must be induced or compelled to surrender his coign
of vantage to the new generalissimo, who will then be able
alternately to pour a broadside into the Government or to enfilade
the ex-Ministers who aid and abet them.</p>
<p>Then there are those humanized notes of interrogation like Mr.
KING, Mr. HOGGE and Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING. They would like
Parliament to be in permanent session in order that the world might
have the daily benefit of their searching investigations. Mr. KING
has not yet quite run into his best form. He had only six Questions
on the Paper, and actually asked only five of them&mdash;a
concession which so paralysed the MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION, to
whom the missing Question was addressed, that, when asked where his
department was located, he had to confess that he did not know the
precise number, but it was somewhere in Queen Anne's Gate.</p>
<p>Eclipsed in Ireland by the more spectacular attractions of Sinn
Fein, the Nationalists' only hope of recovering their lost
popularity is to kick up the dust of St. Stephen's. Accordingly Mr.
REDMOND gave notice of yet another Vote of Censure on the Irish
Executive, but whether for its slackness or its brutality the terms
of his motion do not make quite clear. Perhaps he has not yet made
up his own mind on the subject.</p>
<p>I feel sure that Mr. MONTAGU has a sense of humour, and I
admired the way in which he concealed its existence when explaining
the Indian Government's release of Mrs. BESANT. As he read the
VICEROY'S reference to "the tranquillizing effect of Mr. MONTAGU'S
approaching visit" the House rippled with laughter; and when he
proceeded to say that Mrs. BESANT had undertaken to use her
influence to secure "a calm atmosphere for my visit," the ripple
became a wave. But with the stoicism of the unchanging East he read
on unmoved.</p>
<p>Mr. KENNEDY JONES, taking up the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the
newsboy in a recent cartoon, invited the Government to give the
Germans the monosyllabic equivalent for a very warm time. Mr. BONAR
LAW declined to commit himself to the actual term, but announced
the intention to set up a new Air Ministry, and to "employ our
machines over German towns so far as military needs render us free
to take such action."</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Punch's question, "Why?" I think the answer
most Members would make would be, "Because we wanted to see what
the Ladies' Gallery would look like without the grille." It must be
confessed that those who cherished visions of a dull assembly made
glorious by flashing eyes, white arms, and brilliant dresses were
disappointed.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Stone walls do not a prison make,</p>
<p>Nor iron bars a cage,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>wrote LOVELACE. Well, the iron bars have gone, but the stone
walls remain, and make, if not a prison, something very like a
<i>purdah</i>; and the "angels alone that soar above" are almost as
much cut off from the inferior beings below them as they were
before Sir ALFRED MOND came to the rescue of Beauty in thrall. He
is rather disappointed at getting so little change out of his
"fiver."</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, October 17th</i>.&mdash;The latest recruit to what
JOHN KNOX would have called the "monstrous regiment of Ministers"
is Mr. WARDLE, lately Chairman of the Labour Party. He made a
promising <i>d&eacute;but</i>. Mr. HOGGE professed to be anxious as
to the future of the North-Eastern Railway, which, according to
him, had lent all its "genii" to the Admiralty. Mr. WARDLE, quick
to note the classical accuracy of the plural, assured him that he
need be under no apprehensions&mdash;"there are still some genii
left."</p>
<p>Ireland is to have the extended franchise conferred by the
Representation of the People Bill, but not the accompanying
redistribution of seats. The Chairman suggested that Sir JOHN
LONSDALE, who wanted to do away with the anomaly, should move a
supplementary schedule embodying his own ideas of how Ireland
should be redistributed. Unfortunately&mdash;for one would have
liked to see how much was left for the other three provinces after
he had designed an Ulster commensurate with his notion of its
relative importance&mdash;the hon. Baronet demurred to this
tempting proposal, and thought it was a matter for the
Government.</p>
<p>Some very pleasant badinage between Lord HUGH CECIL and the HOME
SECRETARY as to the relative merits of the words "dwell" and
"reside" for the purpose of defining a voter's qualification was
followed by an exhaustive and exhausting lecture by Major CHAPPLE
on how to tabulate the alternative votes in a three-cornered
election. His object was to demonstrate that under the Government
scheme the man whom the majority of the voters might desire would
infallibly be rejected, while by a plan of his own, which he had
tried successfully on a couple of wounded soldiers, the best man
invariably won.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, October 18th</i>.&mdash;The most obliging of men,
Sir ALFRED MOND nevertheless draws the line when he is asked to
look a gift horse in the mouth. His predecessor at the Office of
Works having offered a site for a statue of President LINCOLN, it
is not for him <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id=
"page289"></a>[pg 289]</span> to challenge the artistic merit of
the sculpture, which has been picturesquely described as "a tramp
with the colic." It is thought that the American donors, after an
exhaustive study of our outdoor monuments, have been anxious to
conform to British standards of taste.</p>
<p>The "Nationals" are beginning to move. Their General elicited
from the Government a promise to introduce a Vote of Thanks to His
Majesty's Forces; though it is possible that this would have been
done without his intervention. His lieutenants were less
successful. Sir RICHARD COOPER could not persuade Mr. BONAR LAW to
publish the official report on the loss of the <i>Hampshire</i>,
and is now more than ever convinced that K. OF K. is languishing in
a German prison-camp; while the HOME SECRETARY intimated that he
required no instruction from Major ROWLAND HUNT in the business of
suppressing seditious literature.</p>
<p>After all, Ireland is to be redistributed. Unless the success of
the Convention renders the task superfluous, the Government will
appoint a Boundary Commission as an act of simple justice. Needless
to say the announcement was received with frenzied abuse by all the
Nationalist factions. Abstract justice, it seems, is the very last
thing that Ireland wants.</p>

<h2>GADGETS AND STUNTS.</h2>
<p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Aware as you must be of a deplorable
confusion now prevailing in the public mind as to the true
inwardness of the expressions "gadget" and "stunt," you will agree,
I am sure, that the moment has come for a clear and authoritative
ruling on this vexed point. At a time when the pundits of the
Oxford Dictionary are coldly aloof, like GALLIO, and the Army
Council, though often approached, studiously reserve their
decision, it rests with you Mr. Punch, as Arbiter of National
Opinion, to give judgment.</p>
<p>What notion, then, of "gadget" and "stunt" is gained by the
young subaltern of today as he joins his regiment and shakes down
to the fundamental facts of life and death? He finds himself
harassed by no end of devilish enemy stunts, to stultify which a
fatherly all-wise War Office has given him an infinity of gadgets.
For every stunt an appropriate countering gadget. Does the foe
strafe him with a gas-bombing stunt? "Ha, ha!" laughs he, and dons
that unlovely but priceless gadget, his box-respirator. But by no
means all gadgets have just one peculiar stunt to counter; such a
definition would exclude, for instance, the height-gauge on a
plane, which is emphatically, wholly and eternally a gadget of
gadgets. Moreover, gadgets are small things. The airman's
"joystick" is a gadget; the tank is not. Now are these views sound,
Sir, or is it permissible, as one authority does, to describe
persons as "gadgets"?</p>
<p>One final word. A nervous subaltern recently appeared before his
Adjutant and called the Wurzel-Flummery Electro-Dynamical
Apparatus, Mark II., "this sky-plotter stunt." "Great Heavens!"
gasped the Adjutant, "what is the Service coming to? Stunt? Gadget,
man, gadget!" Three days later the hapless boy found himself
desired to resign on the grounds of "gross ignorance of military
terminology."</p>
<p>I am, dear Mr. Punch,</p>
<p>Yours solemnly,</p>
<p>ARCHIBALD.</p>

<h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>
<h4>(<i>The GERMAN KAISER, the Tsar of BULGARIA, and the Sultan of
TURKEY.</i>)</h4>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. You must admit that Sofia is a most agreeable
place. Where else could you find such genuine and overwhelming
enthusiasm for the War and our alliance?</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. I don't know. It didn't seem to me exactly
violent; but then, of course, you know your people better than I
do, and it may be&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. Umph.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. I know just what you are going to say, MEHMED.
You feel, as we do, that the voice of the People is the true guide
for a ruler. You feel that too, don't you, WILHELM?</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. I have never hesitated to say so. It is on
such sentiments that the greatness of our Imperial House is
based.</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. Umph.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. There&mdash;I knew you would agree with us. You
heard, WILHELM? MEHMED agrees with us.</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. That is, of course, immensely gratifying.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. We will at once publish an announcement in all
our newspapers. It will declare that the three Sovereigns, after a
perfectly frank interchange of views, found no subject on which
there was even the shadow of a disagreement between them, and are
resolved in the closest alliance to continue the War against the
aggressive designs of the Entente Powers until a satisfactory peace
is secured. How does that suit you, WILHELM?</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. Very well. Only you must put in that bit
about my being actuated by the highest and most disinterested
motives.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. That applies to all of us.</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. Umph.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. Again he agrees. Isn't it wonderful? I've never
met a more accommodating ally. It's a real pleasure to work with
him. Now then, we're all quite sure, aren't we, that we really want
to go on with the War, and that we utterly reject all
peace-talk?</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. Utterly&mdash;but if they come and <i>sue</i>
to us for peace we might graciously consider their offer.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. That means nothing, of course, so there's no
harm in putting it in. At any rate it will please the POPE. We're
quite sure, then, that we want to go on with the War? Of course I'm
heart and soul for going on with it to the last gasp, but I cannot
help pointing out that at present Bulgaria has got all she wants,
and my people are very fond of peace.</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. Umph.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. He knows that is so. He's very fond of peace
himself. You see he hasn't had much luck in the War, have you,
MEHMED?</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. The English&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. Quite true; the English are an accursed
race.</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. The English have a lot of&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. A lot of vices? I should think they have.</p>
<p><i>The Sultan (persisting)</i>. The English have a lot of men
and guns.</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. Well done, old friend; you've got it off your
chest at last. I hope you're happy now. But, as to this peace of
ours, can't something be done? I always say it's a great thing to
know when to stop. So it might be as well to talk about peace, even
if your talk means nothing. In any case, I tell you frankly, I want
peace.</p>
<p><i>The Kaiser</i>. FERDINAND!</p>
<p><i>The Tsar</i>. Oh, it's no use to glare at me like that. If it
comes to glaring I can do a bit in that line myself.</p>
<p><i>The Sultan</i>. The Americans&mdash;</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<h3>"DEAR BRUTUS."</h3>
<p>There are great ways of borrowing, as EMERSON said, and in his
new Fantasy Sir JAMES BARRIE has given us a very charming variation
on <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> (with echoes of <i>Peter
Pan</i> and <i>The Admirable Crichton</i>). Certainly I got far
more fun out of his deluded lovers in the Magic Wood than I ever
extracted from the comedy of errors which occurred between the
ladies and gentlemen of the Court of <i>Theseus</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Dear Brutus</i> the contrast between real life and the
life of Magicland is sharply accentuated by the fact that there is
not a separate set of characters for each; the same men and women
figure in both, making abrupt transitions from one to the other and
back again. We have a house party of actual humans (not too
obtrusively actual), most of whom, including the butler, imagine
that if they could have a Second Chance in life they would not make
such a mess of it as they did with the First. One of them thinks he
would never have taken to drink and lost his self-respect and his
wife's love if he had only had a child; one that he would not have
become a pilferer if he had stuck to the City; others that they
would have done better to have married Somebody Else. Well, they
are all whisked off into the Magic Wood, and there they get their
Second Chance. The pilferer becomes a successful tradesman in a
large and questionable way; the tippler finds himself sober and
attended by the daughter of his heart's desire; various married
folk get re-sorted; and so forth.</p>
<p>The moral purpose (if any) of the author, as conveyed to us
through the mouth of the leading humourist of the party, is to show
that a man's nature would remain the same even if he got a Second
Chance. Unfortunately&mdash;but what can you expect in the realm of
Magic?&mdash;the scheme does not work out with any logical
consistency. It is true that the philanderer and the pilfering
butler show little promise of making anything out of their Second
Chance; but, on the other hand, the childless tippler seems to have
gone reformation and recovered his wife's regard; and if I rightly
interpret certain delicate indications, they propose to have a
pearl of a daughter later on. Also the dainty and supercilious
<i>Lady Caroline</i>, who in the wood becomes enamoured of the
butler-turned-plutocrat (<i>cf. Titania</i> and <i>Bottom</i>) and
subsequently returns to her sniffiness, cannot be said to have lost
much by failing to utilise her Second Chance.</p>
<p>However, one might never have troubled about Sir JAMES'S logic
if he had not declared his moral purpose in set terms. I suppose he
had to explain his title, which was sufficiently obscure. It comes,
as Mr. SOTHERN kindly informed us, from the lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</p>
<p>But in ourselves."</p>
</div>

<h3>IN AND OUT OF THE WOOD.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Mr. Purdie</i> MR. SAM SOTHERN.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Coade</i> MR. NORMAN FORBES.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Dearth</i> MR. GERALD DU MAURIER.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Brutus</i>, in fact, is the famous general to whom certain
things were caviare. He is the typical man in the audience, to whom
Sir JAMES says: "You, too, Brutus; I'm talking at you."</p>
<p>Happily (for my taste, anyhow) the humour of the play dominates
its sentiment. And where the sentiment of the child <i>Margaret</i>
threatens to overstrain itself we had always the healthy antidote
of Mr. DU MAURIER'S practical methods to correct its tendency to
cloy. He was extraordinarily good both as himself and, for a rare
change, as somebody quite different. Miss FAITH CELLI as his
daughter&mdash;a sort of <i>Peter Pan</i> girl who does grow up,
far too tall&mdash;was delightful in the true BARRIE manner. It was
a pity&mdash;but that was not her fault&mdash;that she had to end
her long and difficult scene on rather a false note. I am almost
certain that no child (outside a BARRIE play), who is left alone in
a Magic Wood, scared out of her life, would cry aloud, "Daddy,
daddy, I don't want to be a Might-have-been." The sentiment of the
words was, of course, part of the scheme, but it was not for her to
say them.</p>
<p>Mr. NORMAN FORBES, in the Wood, was an elderly piping faun and
performed with astonishing agility a sword-dance over a stick
crossed with his whistle. Elsewhere as <i>Mr. Coade</i> he played
very engagingly the part of the only character who had made such
good use of his First Chance that he really didn't need a Second.
Both in name and nature he brought to mind the late Mr. CHOATE, who
gallantly declared that if he had not been what he was he would
have liked to be his wife's second husband. And no wonder that
<i>Mr. Coade</i> wanted nothing better than to remain attached to
so adorable a creature as his wife, played with a delightful
homeliness by Miss MAUDE MILLETT, who has lost nothing of that
charm to which, with <i>Mr. Coade</i>, we retain the most faithful
devotion.</p>
<p>Mr. WILL WEST was admirable as a <i>Crichton</i> gone wrong; and
Mr. SOTHERN, as the philanderer <i>Purdie</i>, took all his Chances
of humour, and they were many, with the greatest aplomb. They
included some very pleasant satire on stage manners. I have only to
mention the names of Miss HILDA MOORE, Miss JESSIE BATEMAN, Miss
DORIS LYTTON and Miss LYDIA BILBROOKE for you to understand how
excellent a cast it was, both for wit and grace.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. ARTHUR HATHERTON, as <i>Lob</i>, the host of the
party, a kind of hoary old <i>Puck</i> who had a <i>penchant</i>
for filling his house every Midsummer Eve with people who wanted a
Second Chance, interpreted Sir JAMES'S whimsical fancy to the very
top of freakishness.</p>
<p>I hope, but doubtfully, that there are enough Dear Brutuses in
London (so many aliens have lately fled) to do justice to BARRIE at
his best.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>
<p>I have often pitied the lot of the costume novelist, faced with
the increasing difficulty of providing fresh and unworn trappings
for his characters. Therefore with all the more warmth do I
congratulate those seasoned adventurers, AGNES and EGERTON CASTLE,
on their acumen in discovering such a setting as that of
<i>Wolf-lure</i> (CASSELL). The name alone should be worth many
editions. Nor do the contents in any sort belie it. This remote
country of Guyenne, a hundred years ago, with its forests and caves
and subterranean lakes, with, moreover, its rival wolf-masters,
Royal and Imperial, and its wild band of coiners, is the very stage
for any hazardous and romantic exploit. It should be added at once
that the authors have taken full advantage of these possibilities.
From the moment when the wandering English youth who tells the tale
wakes on the hillside to find himself contemplated by a lovely
maiden and a gigantic wolf-hound, the adventure dashes from thrill
to thrill unpausing. One protest however I must utter. The conduct
of the young and lovely heroine (as above) and her single-minded
devotion to her lover may be true to nature, but somewhat alienated
my own sympathies, already given to the first-person-singular
English lad who also adored her, and whom both she and her chosen
mate treated abominably. To my thinking, unrequited devotion has no
business in a tale of this sort. Realistic pathos may have its
<i>Dobbin</i> or <i>Tom Pinch</i>, but the wild and whirling
episodes of tushery demand the satisfactory finish hallowed by
custom. With this reservation only I can call <i>Wolf-lure</i>
about the best adventure-novel that the present season has
produced.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Since the opening pages of <i>Calvary Alley</i> (HODDER AND
STOUGHTON) are concerned with choir-boys and a cathedral and a
rose-window, things to which one gives, without sufficient reason,
an association exclusively of the Old World, I was a little
startled, as the action proceeded, by the mention of cops and dimes
and trolly-cars. Of course this only meant that I had forgotten,
ungratefully, the country in which any story by ALICE HEGAN RICE
might be expected to be laid. Anyhow, <i>Calvary Alley</i> proves
an admirable entertainment, a tale of a girl's expanding fortunes,
from the grim slum that gives its name to the book, through many
varied experiences of reform schools, a bottling factory and
membership of the ballet, up to the haven of matrimony. Through
them all, <i>Nance</i>, the heroine, carries a very human and
engaging personality, so that one is made to see the young woman
who is clasped to the heroic breast on the last page as the logical
development of the ragged urchin stamping her bare foot into the
soft cement of <i>Calvary Alley</i> on the first.
Moreover&mdash;wonder of wonders for transatlantic
fiction!&mdash;the author is able to write about children, and the
contrasted lives of rich and poor city dwellers, without lapsing
into sentimentality, <i>O si sic omnes!</i> But either American
bishops are strangely different from the English variety, or Mrs.
RICE, following Mr. WELLS'S example, has permitted herself an
episcopal burlesque. In either case the resulting portrait is
hardly worthy of an otherwise admirably-drawn collection of
original characters.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg

<p><i>Christine</i> (MACMILLAN) contains a very illuminating
picture of Germany in the months immediately preceding the War; but
I am perplexed&mdash;and a little provoked&mdash;by the way in
which it is presented. The book opens with a pathetic foreword,
signed by Miss ALICE CHOLMONDELEY, in which we read: "My daughter
Christine, who wrote me these letters, died at a hospital in
Stuttgart on the morning of August 8th, 1914, of acute double
pneumonia.... I am publishing the letters just as they came to me,
leaving out nothing.... The war killed Christine, just as surely as
if she had been a soldier in the trenches.... I never saw her
again. I had a telegram saying she was dead. I tried to go to
Stuttgart, but was turned back at the frontier." Then follows a
Publishers' note to the effect that some personal names have been
altered. After this one is naturally surprised to find the book
advertised as a "new novel." All I can say is that, if Miss
CHOLMONDELEY'S preface is true, her book is not a novel, and that,
if it is untrue, I do not think the foreword is fair or in good
taste. My opinion, for what it is worth, is that Miss CHOLMONDELEY
was herself in Germany during the summer of 1914, and has chosen
this way of telling us what she saw and heard. Anyhow the letters
are undoubtedly the work of someone who knows Germany and the
inhabitants thereof. And for this excellent reason <i>Christine</i>
should not be missed by anyone who wants to know in what a state of
militant anticipation the Germans were living. The strongest
searchlight has been thrown over the Hun, from the habitu&eacute;s
of a middle-class boarding-house to members of the Junker breed.
Whether these letters ought to be classed as fiction or not they
contain facts, and as they are written in a style at once vivid and
engaging my advice to you is to read them and not worry too much
about the foreword.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>The Four Corners of the World</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is
emphatically what I should call a fireside book. On these chill
Autumn evenings, with the rain or the dead leaves or the shrapnel
whirling by outside, you could have few more agreeable companions
than Mr. A.E.W. MASON, when he is, as here, in communicative mood.
He has a baker's dozen of excellent tales to tell, most of them
with a fine thrill, out of which he gets the greatest possible
effect, largely by the use of a crisp and unemotional style that
lets the sensational happenings go their own way to the nerves of
the reader. As an example of how to make the most of a good theme,
I commend to you the story pleasantly, if not very originally,
named "The House of Terror." Before now I have been ensnared to
disappointment by precisely this title. But Mr. MASON'S House holds
no deception; it genuinely does terrify; and when at the climax of
its history the two persons concerned see the door swing slowly
inwards, and "the white fog billowed into the room," while "Glyn
felt the hair stir and move upon his scalp," I doubt not that you
will almost certainly partake of some measure of his emotion.
Naturally, in a mixed bag such as this, one can't complain if the
quality of the contents varies. Not all the tales reach the level
of "The House of Terror"; but in every one there is enough artistry
to occupy any spare half-hour you may have for such purposes,
without letting you feel afterwards that it was wasted. And as a
hospital present the collection could hardly be beaten.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Miss MARJORIE BOWEN'S historical romances usually have the merit
of swift movement, and that is precisely the quality I miss in
<i>The Third Estate</i> (METHUEN). It does not march&mdash;at least
not quick enough. You will not need to be told that Miss BOWEN has
saturated herself conscientiously in her period&mdash;an intensely
interesting period too&mdash;and has contrived her atmosphere most
competently and plausibly. But for all that I couldn't make myself
greatly interested in the bold bad Marquis DE SARCEY in those
anxious two years before "the Terror," with his insufferable pride,
his incredible elegance, his fantastic ideas of love and his
idiotic marriage, the negotiations for which, with the resulting
complications, take up so large a space in a lengthy book. It gives
one the impression of being written not "according to plan" but out
of a random fancy, with so hurried a pen that not merely have
irrelevant incidents, absurdities of diction, and indubitable
<i>longueurs</i> escaped excision, but such lapses from the King's
fair English as "save you and I" and "I shoot with my own hand he
who refuses." Even a popular author&mdash;indeed, especially a
popular author&mdash;owes us more consideration than that.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>The Fortunes of Richard Mahony</i> (HEINEMANN) is one of
those pleasant books in which the hero prospers. True, the process
as here shown is very gradual; so much so that the four hundred odd
pages of the present volume only take us as far as "End of Book
One." Clearly, therefore, Mr. H.H. RICHARDSON has more to follow;
and, as one should call no hero fortunate till his author has
ceased writing, it is as yet too early for a final pronouncement
upon <i>Richard Mahony</i>. My own honest impression at this stage
would be that he is in some danger of outgrowing his strength. This
pathological phrase comes the more aptly since <i>Richard's</i>
fortune, though begun in the goldfields, was not derived from
digging, but from the practice of medicine, and from a lucky
speculation in mining stock (I liked especially the description of
the day when the shares sold at fifty-three, and <i>Richard</i>
"went about feeling a little more than human"). The end of the
whole matter, at least the end for the present, is that, with his
wife, and what he can get together from the remains of the mining
<i>coup</i>, and the sale of a somewhat damaged practice,
<i>Richard</i> sets forth for England. Obviously more turns of
fortune are in store there for him and <i>Mary</i> and that queer
character, his one-time inseparable, <i>Purdy</i>. That I
anticipate their future with much interest is a genuine tribute to
the humanity in which Mr. RICHARDSON has clothed his cast.
<i>Richard Mahony</i>, in short, is a real man, whose fortunes take
a genuine hold upon one's attention; though I repeat that I could
wish his author had told them less wordily, and&mdash;in one
glaring instance&mdash;with a greater respect for the decencies of
medical reticence.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
